2. Install Ashell (https://f-droid.org/en/packages/in.sunilpaulmathew.ashell/)

4. (Optionally, install ShizuTools (https://github.com/legendsayantan/ShizuTools/blob/master/app/release/app-release.apk) and enable the Intent Shell, if you want to execute ADB commands from any app that has the ability to send custom intents, e.g. [MacroDroid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arlosoft.macrodroid))
